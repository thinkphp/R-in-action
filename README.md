```

## Why use R

* It is a great resource for data analysis, data visualization, data science and machine learning
* It provides many statistical techniques (such as statistical tests, classification, clustering and data reduction)
* It is easy to draw graphs in R, like pie charts, histograms, box plot, scatter plot, etc++
* It works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)

# Variables

```
# Assign the same value to multiple variables in one line
var1 <- var2 <- var3 <- "Orange"

# Print variable values
var1
var2
var3
```

## Data Types

```
# numeric
x <- 10.5
class(x)

# integer
x <- 1000L
class(x)

# complex
x <- 9i + 3
class(x)

# character/string
x <- "R is exciting"
class(x)

# logical/boolean
x <- TRUE
class(x)
```

## if/else Control Flow

```
a <- 33
b <- 200

if (b > a) {
  print("b is greater than a")
}
```

## While loop Control Flow

```
i <- 1
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```

## For loop Control Flow

```
for (x in 1:10) {
  print(x)
}
```

## Function

```
my_function <- function(fname) {
  paste(fname, "Griffin")
}

my_function("Peter")
my_function("Lois")
my_function("Stewie")
```
